# My Personal Project

## Project Description
An aim training program that will have targets appear, and the user is supposed to "shoot" the targets . 
The program will record every session, analyze the shots taken by comparing the position
of the shots taken to the position of the target, and give aim adjustment advice to the user after every session. 
Statistics from each session, such as headshot percentage, body shot percentage, leg shot 
percentage, and the final aim adjustment advice generated by all the shots taken in each session will be recorded and 
available for perusal in the future.

## Predicted Users and Ideation
This program will help **individuals who play first-person shooter games** improve their aim. This project is of interest to
me, because I play first-person shooter games such as Valorant. Though aim training systems do exist in the market
already, I have found that the programs just expect you to blindly shoot at targets instead of offering feedback based 
off of your performance while using the program. Since the shots taken during aim training sessions should be pretty 
indicative of the user's shooting habits, it would be a waste to not use all this valuable data to help improve the 
user's aim. Therefore, I wanted to create an aim training program that offers live feedback for the user's performance. 
Users will also be able to see their progression in aiming, since they would be able to access past sessions' 
statistics.
 

## User stories
As a user, I want to be able to :
- choose a point where my bullet is going (for console, it could be typed coordinates, for
the visualized program, it could be where the mouse taps on the interface) and have it be recorded
- adjust the distance between targets and my avatar
- analyze past shots in current session and get aim adjustment feedback (for example, "aim down" if I tend to 
shoot above my target)
- adjust my mouse sensitivity
- start a new training session and add it to the record of all training sessions
- view a list of the every session and its relating statistics (for example, session 1 could be
on Oct 1, 2023, with a headshot percentage of 10%, body shot percentage of 40%, and leg shot 
percentage of 10%, with the final aim adjustment feedback being "aim higher")
- add multiple (all) shots taken to a list of shots taken by the user in every session
- be able to view a list of all shots and suggestions given after ending the current session, as well as the final accuracy and summary 
suggestion given
- be able to save my current session to file
- be able to have the option to reload the file of a previous session and continue the session
